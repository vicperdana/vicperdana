# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm a [Software Solution Engineer](https://linkedin.com/in/vperdana) currently working at Microsoft. ##

âš¡ As a software architect and engineer, Vic started his career working in many different industries, non-profit and profit organisations spanning telco, financial, entertainment, and energy & manufacturing industries. I bridge engineering innovations with real-world business outcomes through AI, cloud-native development, and open source. Vic mostly focuses on:
* [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) ðŸ‘‰ The most comprehensive cloud service platform,
* [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) ðŸ‘‰ The most high-performing programming language, and
* [Semantic Kernel](http://aka.ms/semantic-kernel) ðŸ‘‰ The most flexible way to infuse agents into your apps.
<br/>

:rocket: I kicked off the APAC/ANZ Public Office Hours for [Semantic Kernel SDK](https://aka.ms/semantic-kernel), an open source project to enable developers build advanced applications using Large Language Models. Review recordings of previous sessions on [YouTube](https://aka.ms/sk/officehours/recordings).

## I'm currently... ##
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a maintainer and contributor to the following projects:
- [SemantiClip](https://github.com/vicperdana/SemantiClip): a sample project processing application that transforms video content into rich, structured written formats. Built with Semantic Kernel Agent and Process Frameworks, SemantiClip automates the transcription, segmentation, and content generation process - demonstrating agents orchestration with the use of SLM & LLM.
- [AspireShopWithSemanticKernel](https://github.com/vicperdana/AspireShopWithSemanticKernel): a sample project demonstrating how to "power up" your shopping cart application with AI powered by .NET Aspire and Semantic Kernel.
- [PSDocs](https://github.com/Microsoft/PSDocs): Generate documentation from Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- [PSDocs-vscode](https://github.com/Microsoft/PSDocs-vscode): a Visual Studio code extension for PSDocs.Azure.
- [PSDocs.Azure](https://github.com/Azure/PSDocs.Azure): Generate documentation from Azure infrastructure as code (IaC) artifacts.
